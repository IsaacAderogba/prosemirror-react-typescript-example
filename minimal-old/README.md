# Minimal editor example (generated using CRA at 29.6.2020)

This example was mostly copied and modified from here https://gist.github.com/esmevane/7326b19e20a5670954b51ea8618d096d

Its goal is to provide the minimal required boilerplate to bootstrap a project with ProseMirror, React and TypeScript. It probably won't be something you'd want to directly, but something you want to look at to see how everything works together. The `full` editor example should have the rest of the boilerplate needed to build a real, robust editor.

## Commands

Can be found in `package.json`. Use `yarn <cmd>` or `npm run <cmd>` or sometimes `npm <cmd>` works too.
