# ProseMirror + React + TypeScript example editor

Just the basic boilerplate needed to get going with this combo.

The `minimal` folder contains the absolute minimum required to get started with it.

The `full` folder should, at one point, have all the extra functionality that might come handy when creating a fully-fledged editor with all the bells and whistles.

Contributions or comments would be appreciated.
