# [ProseMirror + React + TypeScript example editor](https://teemukoivisto.github.io/prosemirror-react-typescript-example/)

Just the basic boilerplate needed to get going with this combo.

To get started go to the folder and start the app eg:
```bash
cd full
yarn
yarn start
```

The `minimal` folder contains the absolute minimum required to get started with it.

The `full` folder should, at one point, have all the extra functionality that might come handy when creating a fully-fledged editor with all the bells and whistles.

Contributions or comments would be appreciated.
